Design such a multi-Client system to implement a “Chat Room” as follows:
a. The Client process acts like a chat window. It takes user input, sends
appropriate requests to the Server, and displays the messages sent by
the server to the human user.
b. The Server process acts like a chat room manager. It allows client
processes to login to the chat room (each client needs to have a
unique name). The server keeps track of all the clients that are
currently logged in. Whenever any interesting event happens, (such as
new user logging in or leaving the chat room) the status is broadcast to
all connected clients. Also, whatever each user types is broadcast to all
clients.
c. At the beginning, the user is requested for a “login name”. The client
process then sends a login request to the chat room (Server) with this
name.
d. After logging in, whatever lines the user types is broadcast to all clients
along with the sender’s name.
