Design and implement a Client-Server system that uses TCP sockets to do the following:
a. The client initiates communication with a Server by sending the server
it’s name. (Choose some name for your client process). The Server 
remembers this name for the entire duration of the communication
session.
b. The client then runs in an infinite loop where it accepts a line of input
from the user. The user is expected to enter a string consisting of two
numbers and a simple arithmetic operation (separated by spaces), for
example: “12 + 42” or “3.24 45” or “4.5 / -6” . If the input is not correctly
formatted, a warning is displayed to the user. If correctly formatted, the
Client sends this string to the Server.
c. The Server runs an infinite loop where it keeps waiting for requests
from this client. Upon receiving a request, the server prints the received
message, computes the answer by performing the arithmetic operation
and sends it back as a string. The Client prints the answer it received
from the server.
d. When the user wishes to stop, they enter “q”. The client process
forwards the “q” to the Server upon which the server ends the
communication session and prints “Session ended”. The Client
processes stops.
