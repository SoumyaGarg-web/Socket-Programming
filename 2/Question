//
Design and implement a Client-Server system that uses UDP sockets to do
the following:
a. The client sends the server a request. The request string can either be:
“SEND_DATE” or “SEND_TIME”.
b. The server runs in a infinite loop where it keeps waiting for requests.
Whenever it sees a request, it responds by sending either the current
DATE or the current TIME in (HH:MM:SS) format as specified in the
request.
c. When the Client receives a response, it prints it.
d. The Client runs in a loop where it generates multiple such requests,
and the time between successive requests varies randomly between 1-
2 seconds. HINT: You can use the following line of code to generate a
random amount of delay, uniformly distributed between 1-2 seconds:

import time, random
...
time.sleep(random.uniform(1,2))
